# Own Fingerprint Browser — pointer

The design and plan live in the **`eCan_lambda`** repo:

    docs/OWN_FINGERPRINT_BROWSER_PLAN.md

It is kept there because it is backend/infra design and carries operational
detail — bucket layouts, pod lifecycle, and proxy topology — that does not
belong in this repo.

## What is in this repo

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `agent/ec_skills/browser_use_extension/fingerprint/fingerprint_service.py` | fingerprint profile CRUD, stealth JS preparation, `inject_stealth` over CDP. Already called by the browser node. |
| `agent/ec_skills/browser_use_extension/fingerprint/socks_relay.py` | local no-auth SOCKS5 front for an authenticated upstream proxy |
| `agent/ec_skills/browser_use_extension/fingerprint/stealth_injection.js` | the injected stealth script |
| `agent/ec_skills/browser_use_extension/fingerprint/profiles/` | bundled fingerprint profiles |

## Three findings worth knowing before touching any of it

1. **Chromium cannot authenticate to a SOCKS5 proxy.** There is no
   command-line form, and the extension `onAuthRequired` hook that rescues
   authenticated HTTP proxies never fires for SOCKS. Anti-detect vendors solve
   it by patching the browser; we use `socks_relay.py`.
2. **An anti-detect profile's real config is only on the RUNNING process's
   command line.** The vendor's app data holds the Electron app and browser
   binaries, not the profiles — and the process may not be named `chrome.exe`.
3. **Cookies do not cross platforms.** A Windows profile's cookie key is
   wrapped with DPAPI and bound to the Windows account; a Linux pod cannot read
   it, and Chromium treats the cookies as empty rather than erroring. This is
   the single biggest constraint on the cloud design — see the plan.

Status as of 2026-09-17: a live AdsPower Etsy profile has been migrated onto
our own Chromium and driven over CDP successfully. The management system around
it — registry, launcher, node integration — is planned, not built.
